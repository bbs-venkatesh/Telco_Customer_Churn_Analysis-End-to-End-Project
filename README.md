# Telco_Customer_Churn_Analysis-End-to-End-Project

## 1. Project Overview
In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn (the rate at which customers discontinue their service) is a critical challenge. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project aims to analyze customer data from a fictional telecom company to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Business Problem: 
The telecom company is experiencing customer attrition, leading to lost revenue and market share. There is a lack of clear understanding regarding why customers are leaving and who is most likely to churn.

## Project Objectives:

  ### Descriptive Analysis: Understand the current churn rate and profile of churned customers based on demographics, service usage, and billing information.

  ### Diagnostic Analysis: Identify the underlying factors and relationships that contribute to customer churn.

  ### Prescriptive Analysis: Develop data-backed, actionable recommendations to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention strategies.
